Its a personal assistant app which keeps a track of all your social media activities by recording time for which user has used a particular app and may alarm you or send a mail to your parents for violaing the defined limit.    
Moreover, the app saves your unproductive time losses in switching On/Off of Electrical appliances after certain time and does that for you. It can control switching of any Electrical Appliance by help of cheap modules for wired connectiion using audio jack of mobile, bluetooth connection  and GSM module providing infinite range control.
